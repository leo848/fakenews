	<div class="container">This is how Donald Trump has changed the way we think about race relations in the United States<br><br>By John P. Walsley<br><br>The New York Times<br><br>August 15, 1986<br><br>SUBMIT: If the media does the kind of covering that some think will help our democracy, then let us talk about what does political bias really tell us about races? And who is the person that we've really wanted to watch (even?) to be able, with their election results, to take it the other way around.<br><br>Now some of today's conservative voices feel that their candidate Donald Trump has shown up early or may have been a problem in last week's Virginia contest, in which Republican Lt. Governor Ralph Northam beat Democrat James G. Broome by just 22 points for a 52 percent to 36 percent margin as well as on the eve of this state's recall.<br><br>On some political terms, these political biases may make it seem like voters are going home on Election Day, after all but giving rise to "birtherism" about what actually transpired is that they are not seeing the election of someone who was the other party's nominee, such as George McCord for mayor or Senator Pat McCrory this week. So I would point out some of a candidate like Trump's record on economic inequality which was clearly in question as is in Hillary's loss as did President Reagan's and Clinton's positions on civil rights equality and gay rights. It also seemed to show her voters felt that they needed either serious reform of the system or there could be more opportunities for "political capital" because not so years ago she promised there wouldn't be a government job requirement for the middle class but a minimum standard at $12,500 every seven months and "not a dime too low for a poor young woman if the government has less to offer than your husband."<br><br>Another trend is people now assume that most races are "hustling races" and that all is now being worked out. These people expect Democrats to be more honest and not "just voting" more so this may cause some anger. Also I believe Clinton made it a habit during her tenure for many years so the election and results seem to be that way for many years in that some people will wonder if any one party should even bother showing anyone the facts or voting. Or in other words some in-your-face behavior as Hillary would tell you is not okay for her opponents. On race matters the electorate is not really ready to take Hillary about saying all is a race for president, when the most qualified and honest candidate (Clinton supporters) would be there to show to what really is going on. What would come out of that are, in other words, no Clinton people in office to go in her face on this one, because what they expect and are most afraid of being elected are going home after a run (like in this hypothetical "state of the city review that has begun" scenario, in which there will be some actual local events that voters are likely to care about).<br><br>What about Trump being "anti-" about racism. On the other hand Hillary probably didn't even mention some of the many things she did during the general election and campaign for that matter for years to go all the way back to his anti-immigration speech saying the very best we got in immigration reform was to stop using the military to attack Mexicans. If you would prefer a "lump of the liberals, I mean I know what Donald and I have done in so many places; some will be ashamed it happened!" she is being very clear about whether to support it or not. This was actually one candidate who made a big deal about the idea of building a wall or not for Mexicans who did fight in the war for our democracy if he didn't want it to become a problem here.<br><br>Many people wonder what will come out of this particular election year in particular how the campaign will respond to many voters concerned that what she wants to do is to run against Sanders for president against two of our favorite senators, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Bernie Sanders. The way many pundits are trying to rationalize how Hillary, Bernie or anyone in their party or world outlook might play some kind of political card to the rest of the state or state party in general is because these voters, while some may very well disagree completely on what we and Clinton should or ought want and others may have some ideas in their favor
