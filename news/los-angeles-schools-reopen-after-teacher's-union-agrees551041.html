	<div class="container">Los Angeles schools reopen after Teacher's Union agrees to move to a new building<br><br>A teachers union in California agreed Wednesday to move to a new building, but it will not be open to the public for at least another two years, and will be closed for at least several months.<br><br>The union, which is representing about 7,500 teachers, said it was not able to agree to terms with the district after a letter signed by the district's president, Michael G. McConville, was sent to the board of education.<br><br>The new building will be used primarily for teacher training, with the bulk of the training going to other staff.<br><br>The new building is being built by the Los Angeles Teachers Association, which is organized to represent teachers in the public education system. The Los Angeles Times reported in January that the union would not be able to reach a deal with the district because it had not signed the letter.<br><br>The Times noted that the union would continue to represent its members, but said the union "would not be able to offer any form of representation to the district."<br><br>The Times also noted that the union would not be able to provide "a single, effective representation to the district" for the next two years.<br><br>The letter said the school district was not likely to make a decision on the new building until after a full-time faculty member is hired.<br><br>The letter, which was signed by the Los Angeles Teachers Association, also noted that the district's decision to make a decision on the new location was likely to have an impact on future contracts for the school district.<br><br>The Los Angeles Times reported that the union has filed a lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles for $100 million in damages, alleging that the city unlawfully withheld the contract of a teacher with a contract that was signed by the teacher.<br><br>The lawsuit was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, alleging that the contract between the teacher and the district was terminated in 2013 after the city failed to pay the $100 million settlement.<br><br>The lawsuit, filed in April, claims that the teacher's union violated his right to free speech by not being allowed to discuss his contract and his right to organize with other teachers.<br><br>The letter also alleged that the teacher, who will be replaced by an interim superintendent this fall, is violating a policy that would have required him to have an alternate supervisor and a supervisor of his choice.<br><br>In addition to the lawsuit, the school district is also seeking to force the teachers union to pay $100 million in legal fees and other costs.<br><br>The Los Angeles Times' Richard G. Brown contributed to this report.
