Also you can create custom weapons, armour and more in the options, you can open portals with other players, even better options that allows you to kill multiple enemies in a single play. It just sounds fun.<br><br>There are no real obstacles of a specific type or type of level and all these abilities have to be connected to create a level. With this mode all of the different aspects are activated or activated individually or through groups of players.<br><br>But for most of the new features it really is quite fun. The fun with any setting can be very strong when playing with you friends or when your friends just want to play games together.
