	<div class="container">Westerners who once regularly traveled to China for work are increasingly scared to go back as threat of detention rises.<br><br>Chinese authorities now have the ability to detain people without charge or trial if they have a history of violence, such as those who killed two Chinese tourists in Beijing last year.<br><br>They also can ask for medical and psychological help to combat their case, and could even bring back information about the suspects.<br><br>One of the most prominent cases, in which the government has sought to turn a blind eye to the abuse of detainees, involves a young man who was detained by the authorities last year on suspicion of being drunk, who had been arrested several times.<br><br>The government is now seeking to stop him from returning to China and trying to extradite him to the United States, where he will face charges of violent extremism.<br><br>The case comes after China's Supreme People's Court ordered a review of the case after Mr Zhao's lawyer, Yudong Wei, said he had filed for an appeal.
