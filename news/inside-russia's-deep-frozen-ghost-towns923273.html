	<div class="container">Inside Russia's deep frozen ghost towns.<br><br>It's hard to imagine that we would have been much better off if the Russians had kept their word and kept the rest of us informed.<br><br>This seems to me to be the only explanation that would have been possible.<br><br>I still don't know what the Russians were up to, but it seems that they did something like this in the last fifty years of the Cold War:<br><br>First, they launched their own "anti-Communist" propaganda campaign in the western media, which was, ultimately, to discredit the Soviet Union and to convince many Americans that the United States and Western Europe were not on the same side. (I don't know if the campaign was ever conducted, but it was probably more sophisticated than "anti-Communist.")<br><br>Second, they promoted the false idea that the American people were in the wrong (or perhaps were) united around the idea of "total domination."<br><br>Third, they had a secret plan in place to undermine the U.S. and Western governments in order to keep the Russians out. They also had a secret plan to try to get the Russians to drop bombs on U.S. cities in order to prevent the Russians from attacking them.<br><br>That's all quite interesting, but it seems to me that it was all a complete fiction.<br><br>In his book, "The War of the Worlds," Robert F. Kennedy's chief of staff, Robert F. Kennedy wrote that he had "become convinced that, whatever the costs of the war, the United States was in control of Russia, and the United States was in control of the Soviet Union." (I'm not sure if he actually meant that, but I'm not sure it was a lie.)<br><br>This is true, but it is not true that the United States was the real enemy. The Russians did not want to go to war with the United States, and the United States wanted to go to war with Russia.<br><br>The Russians were not in control of the United States, and the United States wanted to go to war with Russia. They had not just a plan, but they were also convinced that it would be better to go to war with Russia than to go to war with the United States.<br><br>And now they are convinced that the United States is in control of Russia.<br><br>(This is the same Russian propaganda that the Americans used in the Cold War: "America is the only superpower that can defeat the Soviet Union.")<br><br>And the Russians are convinced that the United States is in control of Russia.<br><br>The Russians were not in control of the United States, and the United States wanted to go to war with Russia.<br><br>They did not want to go to war with Russia, and the United States wanted to go to war with Russia.<br><br>And now the Russians are convinced that the United States is in control of Russia.<br><br>The Russians are in control of Russia.<br><br>And now the Russians are convinced that the United States is in control of Russia.<br><br>The Russians are in control of Russia.<br><br>The Russians were not in control of the United States, and the United States wanted to go to war with Russia.<br><br>The Russians were in control of Russia.<br><br>The Russians were not in control of the United States, and the United States wanted to go to war with Russia.<br><br>The Russians were not in control of the United States, and the United States wanted to go to war with Russia.<br><br>The Russians were in control of Russia.<br><br>And now the Russians are convinced that the United States is in control of Russia.<br><br>The Russians are in control of Russia.<br><br>And now the Russians are convinced that the United States is in control of Russia.<br><br>The Russians are in control of Russia.<br><br>The Russians are in control of Russia.<br><br>The Russians
