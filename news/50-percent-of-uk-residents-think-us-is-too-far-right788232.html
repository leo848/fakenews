	<div class="container">50 Percent of UK residents think US is too far right<br><br>This week the US Department of Homeland Security sent a letter to Washington asking it "to take steps to curtail the Trump administration's continued expansion of immigration into the United States, including through Executive Order 14333, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals." This order is currently being challenged by six US states.<br><br>Trump has promised he'll take action to bring back DACA for as long as he has five more years left before it expires, but the White House has already vowed it will never pass any bill with bipartisan backing. President-elect Donald Trump, who campaigned on the promise to create thousands of jobs with back-to-back executive orders, has also yet to make any executive actions on immigration he would like in the new months. His most recent administration plan for the US was to issue a sweeping amnesty for illegal immigrants and ban those who came to the US as children and were at risk of deportation under federal law.<br><br>"At a time when immigration enforcement is the fastest-growing job issue of our lifetime, the US needs to take the following actions to improve enforcement: reduce immigration apprehensions; implement and enforce President-elect Donald J. Trump's executive amnesty program as well as any policy measures Congress takes to do so; and remove barriers for unauthorized legal immigrants through border patrols and border enforcement measures across the Northern Border."<br><br>Here's what the US states had to say over the US-DACA letter.<br><br>What is President Obama's approach to immigration enforcement?<br><br>US Department of Homeland Security Secretary Thomas T. Kelly announced in October that he's taking action on reducing the number of people affected by deportation by making "significant change in programs that provide security for working class, middle-class white families to provide legal protections to non-working American workers and immigrant parents." The Department of Homeland Security will ask Congress to block these specific reforms.<br><br>Will President Obama step in and assist the states who signed the letter or the states who declined to sign on?<br><br>"The US Government has an extensive record with which to help states pass and enforce policies against undocumented workers. We will be working diligently to make this process as easy to implement as possible by ensuring a comprehensive border security and enforcement strategy. This letter urges the US Government to give President Donald Trump a number of opportunities to assist his team in implementing these actionable policies as follows:<br><br>Ending the DACA process after seven years of delay<br><br>Repealing the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program to encourage the implementation of the new laws and provide permanent legal residents a pathway to work and continue the work and education they have gained following DACA.<br><br>Repealing the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals law that requires an individual, within 30 days after a minor is turned on legal permanent U.S. citizen, to apply to come into the country for a work permit without a US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USDIS) score, work without legal process, and work once a year or every 20-30 days without a US-issued visa if it would affect those children and those adults living in the US.<br><br>(Source: National Press Club, 7/11/2017, https://www.npsk.org/politics/news/policy-article/96722-us-debt-trading-and-dumping/)<br><br>(Source: White House website, http://donaldjtrump.com/)<br><br>Why is Trump calling on the states to act?<br><br>Trump has often suggested that the states could not block the government's plan with bipartisan support. The White House claims the Obama policy did not help immigrants before the law was passed. "We were working so hard to end DACA right all the way through before it hit us, and the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program was such a huge help that the law helped secure a great deal of our young people from deportation," the Trump Administration wrote. "This was a success story."<br><br>(Source: National Press Club, 7/11/2017, https://www.npsk.org/politics/news/politics/article/96722-american-workers-struggle-after-end-dow---rng4-murdoch-immigration-immunization-and-immigrants-re-enter-countries---in
