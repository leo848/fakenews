It's a hard question to answer, because one has to do a lot of work -- not just of being president. Obama-Clinton, obviously, doesn't have the magic. He probably won't win again. It's not too late for any president to be a political hero. After the election in November, things won't be easy for any other candidate to make history. In fact, this is what can happen when all the wrong people try to push the story, such as a conspiracy theorist, a pedophile, the 'unemployed', the mentally ill. There is a very high likelihood of this happening in the future either now or in the decades ahead.
