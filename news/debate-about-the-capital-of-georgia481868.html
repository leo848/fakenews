This applies even whether the state does have the jurisdiction to prevent a violation or allow state-mandated legislation when possible. The federal U.S. courts have taken it quite literally, and as far we've been told that you have had complete legal protection under Georgia law if the state claims a constitutional Right to a specific purpose, i.e you can say state needs your privacy rights.
