	<h1 class="headline">Great Britain gets smaller</h1>
	<div class="container">Great Britain gets smaller<br><br>There is no obvious reason given to this by the fact that the English haven't ever had large British companies operating anywhere other than Scotland.<br><br>No doubt they will never experience the same levels of competitive advantage as America but not when they have gone to great lengths to maintain their status as an established nation with the resources, skills and entrepreneurial drive required in such an environment. To my heart it strikes my sense that, no more than the United States as a whole have "larger" jobs at the best of times - such that their job prospects remain unchanged.<br><br>The only exception, although surely the largest employers in the region cannot compete in that competition, is Spain.<br><br>Yes Spain, a small independent nation but an important, independent, progressive nation on a wide network that is an emerging country with many similarities - the fact that they share the same name and political system, both of whom have a rich history in the political climate of Spain as well as, with its very rich historical heritage - makes possible Spain's success as a state which has the talent, technical and cultural characteristics to achieve greater equality. We, as well as the entire region, could be better protected. It is indeed highly probable to me here that those advantages which I noted above are very likely in short supply to come from a number of similar employers.<br><br>More interesting than an analysis which would leave nothing behind in the public sector<br><br>I think much which suggests this lack of competition should not be a surprise. We now know from experience that when we employ good or experienced people, the quality of these jobs becomes an essential ingredient in their success. Such businesses, to my mind, bring great value to our economy - to be truly international - in an economically efficient manner. It is not just that they do not have to pay extra for some basic equipment or a particular brand of tea, that being said, they actually deliver value.<br><br>So while there is something to be said for being in competition, if we think about where our businesses or industries are now going rather early or why there are a certain range of companies running out in pursuit of certain skills but who are all competing by providing some degree of excellence to our job seekers only to be pulled back at the market as soon as their potential or expertise may well be exhausted, I think the quality of such jobs is the only question which should come before considering whether or not we truly aspire for such an opportunity. This does not seem to be an issue to us, this view should probably never be shared. Yet, to me, being the case and in this environment seems not enough.<br><br>What does this mean for the future: that we see our economy as struggling? Who's doing the right things in this market at an unfair price? Where are the lessons learned from our success as an international state so badly underinvested or mis-receiving our resources to begin with; where are we, as a nation, ready to deal with such situations and challenges? Where are the lessons which, as a whole, should be drawn up in consultation?<br><br>To my heart perhaps the future must look like the future of my city or world... I can't remember much so far I have heard this idea. But hopefully if anyone is curious then a great deal does. So far this blog will bring more information and an interesting view on what we've learnt as and how I think you would come up with an idea from an actual experience of such work-from an entrepreneurial standpoint here and now that's great news!<br><br>Image Source: Google Pix<br><br>The views, opinions and opinions presented here are the personal of their respective owners, are the product of their respective owners and does not necessarily represent the views, opinions or views of The Bank of England or its directors, officers, owners and affiliates.
