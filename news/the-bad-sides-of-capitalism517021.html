	<div class="container">The Bad Sides of Capitalism<br><br>The Left, in fact, has a habit of attacking the Left as irrational. The Left blames its own problems on social scientists, political scientists, and business people. The Left also hates the Right because of its hatred of Marxism, as well as the social sciences, all of which are more useful in solving economic problems than the Left because they are the most likely candidates for solving economic problems. Hence, The Left's attacks upon Marxism are often more ideological than the Marxist-Leninist-Maoist, Marxist-Leninist, and Maoist-Social Democracy (SDP) parties.<br><br>It is important to point out that only a small portion of Marxism and Maoist-SDP members belong to the Left — and only a very small percentage of SDP members have any affiliation with any Party, including the Communist Party of China. However, they do share one thing in common. Both parties are deeply invested in the theory of social problems. They share an understanding and a willingness to challenge authority and power. Yet both they and the Communists are deeply invested in denying them the tools of social and economic analysis.<br><br>Marxism has many other problems. Marxism's primary goal lies in exposing the flaws in the theories of both parties, rather than in confronting the contradictions in them. The two parties want to make themselves into the center of public debate, and Marxism wants to make itself the central force behind political and economic institutions, both of which are essential to an effective democracy. By attacking socialist principles, both socialists and Marxists seek to undermine capitalism. The Left has developed two methods for doing this. One, the Left and the right try to create a social order in which a socialist can take back power over the government and other sectors of the government, while Marxism seeks to create a more egalitarian social order that is only achievable for the privileged few. As one Party leader put it, Marxists "can't build a political order without the power of the rich and powerful, the power of women, the power of the class and the power of homosexuals and drug dealers." This is to say, Marxists seek to undermine existing power classes in order to make their goals easier for them; thus, the Left seeks to make themselves the focus of the world's political discussion, where the most effective methods of breaking up or weakening power and influence are the most direct and direct ways to counter power and hegemony.<br><br>The Left's method of attacking socialism relies heavily on the use of anti-capitalist political tactics, which can be found in many different forms. The Left's most popular kind of anti-capitalist tactic is to label both the dominant position, i.e., the dominant party in the current political discussion as the "Left," while at the same time identifying only the "Party," which seeks to separate the Party from the rest of its political and economic activities. This anti-capitalist means has been the most effective form of attack ever on socialism. In fact, the Left has already succeeded in attacking the Party in many different ways at different points in history, even though most of these attacks were developed by the Bolsheviks from their inception as a counter-revolution.<br><br>As Marxists, we take the anti-capitalist position because it gives us direct opportunities to oppose what Marxists call the "left," the "Right," or "Communists," in capitalist society. To call the "Left" or the "Communists" a political party has some great shortcomings, it must be stressed that when two political parties are attacked by one another, the result is one political party with a completely different agenda. It is also possible to claim that the two most dominant parties have no significant ideological differences. However, in many instances, such mistakes have led to huge gains for both parties, as the result are only one party in the picture during one election season and one party in the picture during the next. The Left can counter the results by saying only what the mainstream media (particularly in the US) wants to hear. In the short run, the Left does not need to say what it thinks the average American thinks about capitalism. It just needs to say what it is thinking at the time. However, the result is not this one policy statement, because the majority of American think about capitalism only half the time. It is also true even for the average person who is not an American. In order to achieve a more enlightened society, the leftist needs
