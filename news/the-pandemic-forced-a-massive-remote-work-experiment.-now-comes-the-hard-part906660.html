	<div class="container">The pandemic forced a massive remote-work experiment. Now comes the hard part: We need to make sure that the population is not too large to do the work.<br><br>"The best way to prevent a pandemic is to have a lot of people come into the city," says the group's executive director. "People who are in the area. People who are coming from cities. People who are looking for work. People who are just looking for food or something. There's only so many people that can actually get a job. So that's the only way we can save lives."<br><br>The new program will target 10 million people, says the group. The goal is to put the total of all those who have a job in the city within a decade and give them an opportunity to find work. It will also put the city in a position to expand its workforce and to build a more sustainable workforce.<br><br>The program is funded by the city of Seattle, and will be funded on a public-private basis at the time of the grant. The city will also be providing grants to other cities that are participating.<br><br>"We've put the city and the city of Seattle on an equal footing, and the mayor and the mayor's office are working to develop the program," said Paul Davis, director of public health at the Seattle Department of Public Health.<br><br>Davis says the city has already set up a program called "the Neighborhood and Workforce Initiative."<br><br>"The program is an effort to find people willing to work in a relatively small city," he says.<br><br>The initial goal is to get 20,000 people to work in the city in 2017, Davis says.<br><br>In the next five years, a total of 20,000 people will be able to find work in the city, Davis says. A total of 3 million people will work in the area throughout the year, including 9 million who will be employed by the city.<br><br>The Seattle Department of Public Health is also working on a project called the Urban Food Network, which will help people find a job.<br><br>The program will be funded by the city and the city of Seattle through a grant from the Seattle Department of Public Health.<br><br>"You can find jobs not only in the city but across the state and help people find jobs in the city," says Dan Farr, director of the program. "We are very excited about this initiative and are working with people all over the state to make sure that it is successful."<br><br>The program is sponsored by the American Farm Bureau Federation, the Washington State Farm Bureau Federation and the American Farm Association.<br><br>The Food Network is a partnership between the Seattle Department of Public Health and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.<br><br>The Seattle Department of Public Health is a sponsor of the program.<br><br>"We are not only working on this program but we are also working on other programs in Seattle," says Davis.<br><br>The program is funded by the city of Seattle, and will be funded on a public-private basis at the time of the grant. The city will also be providing grants to other cities that are participating.<br><br>"We are going to add more people to our program, so we're going to get more people into our program," says Davis. "And we're going to make sure that the city and the city of Seattle are well-served by partnering with cities to address the needs of people in the city."<br><br>The Seattle Department of Public Health is also working on a project called the Urban Food Network, which will help people find a job.
