	<div class="container">Joe Biden is a good president because<br><br>his policies are fair and responsible and the United States is now in a position to make choices that<br><br>will benefit our country and the world.<br><br>I cannot imagine how you and I can have such unity and unity<br><br>with one another in this election.<br><br>When voters finally get a clear picture of their real priorities,<br><br>and you get voters to decide whether your policies work,<br><br>we'll move forward.<br><br>I want to congratulate President Obama and his family for doing that.<br><br>While we are still in the middle of this election, you are very much behind us.<br><br>We have a lot of work to do. We need to make sure we get to the floor and<br><br>do that the right way.<br><br>And I want to thank the many people who have worked to build this country,<br><br>and many others who have worked to help our country.<br><br>I want you all to enjoy the day and the night after this election.<br><br>As president, I will continue to work to strengthen our democracy and<br><br>better our children's futures. I hope you will continue to serve your country with a<br><br>united heart.<br><br>As a proud nation, I will work to ensure that we never again have a<br><br>trump presidency.<br><br>And as our own president, I will bring the American Dream back to America.<br><br>In the 21st century, Americans will be able to enjoy the great gifts of freedom, equality,<br><br>religion, and individual liberty. Our people deserve a president who will see these gifts<br><br>in the most open, honest, and responsible way.<br><br>The American Dream should come before the wall.<br><br>Thank you for your understanding.<br><br>Thank you for your understanding.<br><br>Thank you for your understanding.<br><br>Thank you for your understanding.<br><br>Thank you for your understanding.<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Jeff Sessions<br><br>Executive Director, National Security And Security Affairs<br><br>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.

Senator Chris Van Hollen,<br><br>Senator Scott Brown, Senator Harry Reid, Senator Mitch McConnell, Senator Rand Paul, Sen<br><br>Tim Scott, Senator Robert Menendez, Senator Robert Menendez, Senator Bob Corker, and Senator Jim Inhofe,<br><br>both in the Senate.<br><br>But the issue that has been raised is not an issue that is just a hypothetical.<br><br>It's a national security issue. It's about a trade deal.<br><br>We've spent a lot of time on the issue, in fact, over the past seven years.<br><br>So we believe that if an American-made pipeline is put in place,<br><br>we should be prepared to defend American sovereignty.
