	<div class="container">America was better 20 years ago than it is today<br><br>The average IQ and education of high school students is about 1.5<br><br>And, that's according to a new book by the Nobel Laureate Philip Roth that warns that the rise of multiculturalism is "the fastest-growing race in human history".<br><br>The book warns: "In a very real sense, in a very real way, all of us are at risk of turning into some sort of racial super-gods because of it". It highlights how our culture is being bred from scratch, it takes a "cultural renaissance" because we have forgotten "the great things" about who we are, or what we believe in.<br><br>The book is titled "The Real Danger of Being White and Being European, in the Age of Trumpism".<br><br>Philip also revealed to the Huffington Post that he's become "quite aware, the better educated the person is, the more the nation becomes more racist", it's becoming harder for the younger generation to remain politically correct (read: right-wing) and, ultimately, this is a big problem for the future of American liberalism.<br><br>Here's an excerpt of the book of his:<br><br>"In my lifetime, Americans have become more racist than ever. And they've become more racist. And they've become more racist - they have no option left - because that's where we are.<br><br>"We have become so disconnected from reality. We are so stupid. And you can get carried away with this thinking that everyone is just like them and nobody cares about a particular political position as long as everything we do is just because it's their opinion.<br><br>"What they are learning now is that it's okay not to be racist. It doesn't matter what people like you are. We're going to be different now. And I'm scared to death my daughters from being white and to have to raise them as white as they possibly can.<br><br>"So I want you to go to another place. But you're not going to give the same service you have given me, you're not going to be an American. And, you know, I am, I want you to be America as best you can, even if it means going abroad now.<br><br>"And you will have to do that the hard way. You'll have to do it with the help of others who understand and come from this side. Like my father. Or my brother. Or my great-grand-great-grandmother."<br><br>If you were to watch a documentary about anti-war protesters filmed by filmmaker Steve Aoki, a white supremacist, and told you to "come out" at the polls to vote for Democrat Hillary Clinton, you'd be horrified.<br><br>If you watched two documentaries about anti-war protesters filmed by filmmaker Steven Aoki, as told in one, you'd be horrified either way.<br><br>Philip's book also highlighted that America's "postmodern identity politics" has "influenced an enormous number of people in the world to become white, that has contributed to the increasing levels of xenophobia.<br><br>"This is very dangerous and it's not just a minority problem, but a real one for American liberalism, for liberalism in general."<br><br>Philip also said we should "become much more multicultural" because we have become "anti-American, anti-American, anti-white, pro-European.<br><br>He added: "The country is the most diverse country in the world, but that doesn't mean it has the best society."<br><br>Philip also said it's "probably going to become pretty nasty at times during the 20th Century."<br><br>He did, however, highlight a recent Pew poll revealing that one-third of Americans say that the US is not the most desirable place in the world.
