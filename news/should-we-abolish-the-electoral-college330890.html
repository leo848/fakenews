	<div class="container">Should we abolish the Electoral College?<br><br>We have an obligation to uphold the Constitution. It is a very real responsibility. If we want to make that a reality – to do that in a way that makes the American people feel better about themselves and their countries – we have to be prepared to do so by making a clear distinction between the two.<br><br>I have said this many times. We need to put aside that notion of a "winner" or "losers" and to think about how that is a legitimate thing to do.<br><br>A majority of voters in this country reject any form of "rigged" election systems, or any attempt to create a "winner" or "losers" coalition. We need to ensure that the system that we have now is working properly. We need to ensure that no candidate gets elected and no other candidate gets elected.<br><br>What's the plan? Would we abolish the Electoral College, or would we abolish the Electoral College altogether?<br><br>We are going to take the Electoral College back to the drawing board.<br><br>Right now, there are not going to be 51 states or territories that voted for Hillary Clinton.<br><br>That's what we have to do.<br><br>As I said, it's not the first time we've put it on the table.<br><br>The system is not broken. It's not broken with the rules. It's not broken with the system being run by a bunch of folks with a vested interest in making that electoral system work.<br><br>How do you explain that?<br><br>I think that if we're able to do that, I think we can do it.<br><br>We've got to do it first.<br><br>I'd like to have the Electoral College abolished. I'd like to have it fully reformed.<br><br>One of the things that I'm going to do is to use eminent domain. I'm going to use eminent domain.<br><br>Here's how eminent domain works.<br><br>As it stands now, you cannot move a building for redevelopment to another location.<br><br>That's a violation of the Constitution.<br><br>I believe that it is unconstitutional.<br><br>Now, I don't know how this is going to be done.<br><br>I know that we need to do some serious thinking. We need to stop that.<br><br>We need to get this done. We need to actually work to actually make sure that this system works.<br><br>The next thing is we have to take the power back to the states.<br><br>We have to take the power back to the states.<br><br>So now it's time to take that power back to the states.<br><br>That's the issue that I want to address now.<br><br>Let's take control of the states.<br><br>That's the issue that I'm going to address now.<br><br>Let's take control of our own legislatures.<br><br>That's the issue that I'll address now.<br><br>Let's take control of the Supreme Court.<br><br>I think that it's going to be very hard.<br><br>How do you think we'll do it?<br><br>I'm not sure what you're going to do. But I'm going to take it over, I'm going to take that over, I'm going to take that over.<br><br>I want to make sure that we're in the position where we're not in a situation where we're not in a situation where we're not in a situation where we're not in a situation where we're not in a situation where we're not in a situation where we're not in a situation where we're not in a situation where we're not in a situation that we're not in a situation where we're not in a situation that we're not in a situation that we're not in a situation that we're not in a situation that we're not in a situation that we're not in a situation that we're not in a situation that we're not in a situation where we're not in a situation that we're not in a situation that we're not in a situation that we're not in a situation that we're not in a situation where we're not in a situation that we're not in a situation that we're not in a situation that we're not in a situation that we're not in a situation that we're not in a situation that we're not in a situation that we
