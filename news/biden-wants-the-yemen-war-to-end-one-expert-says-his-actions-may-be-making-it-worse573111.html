	<div class="container">Biden wants the Yemen war to end. One expert says his actions may be making it worse<br><br>The debate over what should be done to end the war in Yemen is in part a debate over how to respond to the bombing raids carried out by the US and its allies in their campaign against Yemen, and to how close to a legal precedent to rule them out.<br><br>The Arab League condemned the raids in a draft resolution on Tuesday, citing the need for the war to end and said the operation would have the same impact.<br><br>On Tuesday, the UN Security Council approved the resolution, which says the war in Yemen must end within 30 days of "the conclusion of the cessation of hostilities and ending of hostilities without preconditions, without prejudice to the security of United Nations entities."<br><br>It urges the UN to consider a cessation of hostilities to give priority to ensuring the security of civilians, without preconditions.<br><br>The resolution also calls for an immediate end to all aerial strikes, including in the event of a military operation. However, the resolution calls for the UN and its Arab allies to "promote the possibility of effective and sustainable coalition negotiations that would enable the parties to continue to seek a negotiated end to hostilities."<br><br>A senior Saudi diplomat said on behalf of the US that any such a deal would have to be reached immediately.<br><br>The Saudi diplomat said the Saudis could also try to reach an agreement with Syria and, in the process, create military units that would also face military conflict in the event of an intervention by Saudi Arabia.<br><br>"However, as a matter of principle, any such agreement would have to include specific preconditions that would allow for the implementation of the ceasefire," he said.<br><br>Saudi Arabia and some other Gulf nations have been battling the Houthis in Yemen since July.<br><br>Satellite imagery released on Tuesday showed heavy military activity by the Saudi air force in the northern Yemeni city of Aden as the conflict grew deeper into the night.<br><br>The United Nations Security Council last month authorized the deployment of five sorties to the country, on suspicion its air and ground operations contributed to the death of hundreds of civilians on Wednesday.<br><br>In an attempt to broker a ceasefire, the warring sides have taken in two million people, according to the UN.<br><br>On Monday, a Yemeni military spokesman said the United States and its allies had entered an "ongoing" air strike to protect coalition members, in the early hours of Monday.<br><br>The US and its allies are conducting air strikes in the country as war in Yemen intensifies.<br><br>A Saudi general has also said he believes the US-backed Houthis are behind the recent massacre of more than 2,000 people in east Yemen.<br><br>The US has accused Saudi Arabia, which denies responsibility, of supporting the Houthis.<br><br>An Associated Press reporter who spoke to a Yemeni government official said senior coalition commanders had ordered air strikes that have killed at least 50 civilians in a series of recent air strikes.<br><br>The BBC's Tom Slifton in Riyadh says US President Barack Obama has threatened a formal end to military combat in Yemen, but has failed to deliver on any lasting peace accord.<br><br>He fears his administration may be in a position to continue the conflict of the past decade despite his efforts, even if it means waiting for at least another decade or more to close the gulf and turn the tide.<br><br>If that does occur, the question for the Obama administration is whether the US will turn again to airstrikes against the Houthis, whose forces have been fighting on behalf of the Yemeni government.
