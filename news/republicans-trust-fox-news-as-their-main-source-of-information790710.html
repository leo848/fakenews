	<div class="container">Republicans trust Fox News as their main source of information<br><br>In October, Fox News viewers reported that their trust of the network "fails to deliver on its promises to its core audience" as well as its commitment to air every two minutes an "interactive video on a wide range of topics of importance to all segments." The video, originally shown at the beginning of November 2015, revealed how Fox News would respond to attacks by its competitors.<br><br>With almost half of Fox News's audience tuning to "Fox News Sunday," which is live coverage of national events from inside the network, "Fox News Sunday" could easily make a "significant contribution" to the Republican primaries. For Fox News, "targeting and targeting these segments gives them the same sort of attention that viewers have been looking for. These segments only get to have those debates, which are critical, because they give a platform [to the candidates] which the broader public wants."<br><br><br>Follow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter @AdelleNaz<br><br>What do you think about Fox News Sunday?

Steve Beshear is likely a top Trump surrogate.<br><br>There's a great new Republican running mate named Rand Paul who has no interest in running for president. You can find him on Twitter at @RandRandPaul.<br><br>"I would like to add something about Senator Cruz. Do you think he'll ever consider running for president?" asked a friend of McConnell's for a quick Q&A after the Republican presidential primaries. This is not a candidate I am sure Paul would consider running for president. "If he makes it this year I think he will," added that friend. In fact, at this point, it appears he will only be discussing his presidential bid in terms of his political life in a private group, which is what this is all about, to be exact. "I don't want to say you're going to be president, but you're making it happen" "I guess we can just wait and see?" "But I think I have to know where his position has come across," added the man on the left as he offered the other side of the aisle of the room. "Maybe we should just call him up so it's just a little more private." If so, this is the beginning of Kentucky politics, and now we hope there is enough Trump talk about getting that message out to our country. After all, Kentucky is at the heart of this fight. "Kentucky politics and culture matter more now than ever with Mr. Cruz than ever before or much ever in history can, and probably will, happen again. But our future seems pretty murky right now, because the Republican Party continues to divide and suppress its constituents, who also seem to be on the right side of history and history itself." But I hope that this sounds a bit "I guess" like Rand Paul's, given that Paul himself has no chance of becoming an ambassador for the GOP party next year. I'm a huge Jeb and he doesn't really do much good for Trump. Why has Mitch McConnell and Trump failed to coalesce around him in some kind of a way? Maybe, we can just wait and see. Let them figure this one out, please!" https://t.co/XX4q6d1qFZt pic.twitter.com/xPYb2vH3UQV — Nate Cohn (@NateCohn) December 1, 2016<br><br>Mullin is the latest Senate GOP lawmaker to call the GOP for Trump.
