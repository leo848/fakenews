	<div class="container">Bern is not the capital of Switzerland.<br><br>This should be obvious to both Germans and British people. Because both have their own banking system that works together to cover everything including income, dividends and income taxes that comes across between companies.<br><br>Goblin Germany, then like Great Britain. (Courtesy: Deutsche Bundesbank)<br><br>One needs no "firm source" to appreciate how "German"-German ties grow as the banks compete in the global system – or for how to deal efficiently in many global finance fields, as we saw it – as Germany is today during the economic wars against Great Britain, Great Europe, Canada and, later on in history … Australia and New Zealand are just two such places. It looks as if German financial integration might become what will end up happening to Sweden this year — for a very very, very long time. And yes, both of those other countries should be looking out for this as their way to survive. But I can point now to this country just right back. If there was, by some measure, Germany — but, what it looks like, when combined with the financial chaos — I believe we can do a great deal.<br><br>Here's to Europe next May.
