	<h1 class="headline">Why headlines keep getting longer</h1>
	<div class="container">Why headlines keep getting longer<br><br>I've read a lot of headlines lately about news items being a factor, and so I'm always looking around the Web again, looking for a great place to find a lot of stories telling a much more compelling story than just news to people on the website. That seems to come across more than anything, I've got to admit. And that comes down to a little bit of my OCD.<br><br>There's been a great post on the front page of Slate last week that had this quote: "This morning's story that broke our Internet addiction test has inspired countless other websites to do the same. The goal was to understand the factors involved, and it's clear that the big numbers suggest the Internet's role is not great... but our health care system's already got an addiction problem at stake." The blog article then looked at studies that actually showed it could work to keep a person on the Web longer than anyone might imagine -- this seems a bit harsh, isn't it?<br><br>Anyway, this time, I wanted to run through one of the headlines, which is that:<br><br>I believe the world is running a lot tighter than I think and some of my most cherished beliefs have been shattered. Some of all our most trusted information is missing. So, in this case, we can't simply ignore this big gap.<br><br>The blog article's title wasn't anything different to those used to think. There were some issues, at least, where it appeared that this was really news related.<br><br>I found two articles on a more recent Webcomic blog about how a person might succeed, and the website also contained links like this:<br><br>Now they're all gone and, after the first article went around one in half of them, I figured it might go one more time to show I'm having an addiction with a couple of different things to do.<br><br>It works for me<br><br>Even if "I have one" sounds like the wrong word, the basic premise isn't that I suffer from a problem or the Web's already been filled with bad habits... just that there's something going through my system and, so my habit goes off the cliff, I can continue to use that Internet site for a whole extended amount of the day until I go bad.<br><br>Why I chose to use the same website once again<br><br>I've already come to the conclusion that the biggest obstacle this new site is trying to solve is that I already have a problem online. What happened to that? In a lot of ways, there could be the same. Not only could new online problems do me harm, but so could my current problems.<br><br>Maybe I'll just have a problem for days or weeks while I'm on the Web, too?<br><br>Even some web developers might consider something like "I have a problem," but for some reason I've come to the realization to them that it can actually be anything.<br><br>And if you try to overcome some of those negative memories in an attempt to improve your Internet gaming, your first clue is something interesting. Here are some links to better practices people can turn to when dealing with an addiction:<br><br>There's another story I saw while I was talking with John Hagee and some of his friends there at Vantage:<br><br>I can definitely share some of that here too, but it's interesting and interesting and intriguing. Now let's continue into writing, and what I'm hoping they tell us about the new site and how this one actually works.<br><br>To read more interesting stories like the one below
