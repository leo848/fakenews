	<div class="container">Uganda's Bobi Wine calls for peaceful protests after polls<br><br>As the first in Africa's first non-Muslim leader to be elected, Mr Bobi promises to stop discrimination, halt the spread of Boko Haram and open the gates of their country to women and girls.<br><br>But he has also faced criticism from the ruling Liberal Party over an alliance with some extremist groups, who view him as a nationalist.<br><br>Mr Bobi, a Kenyan immigrant, is also a vocal critic of western aid, which he has said is only being pursued to protect his country's future.<br><br>He has called for tougher punishment of leaders and criticised Mr Zuma for failing to honour his call to free all African young people.<br><br>In an interview with the Associated Press newspaper in Ghana, he said: "I am not aware of any people where they've come from without permission.<br><br>"But I am sure if a group like Boko Haram has been unleashed then they will come as well.<br><br>"I think everybody can come out and protest."<br><br>He went on to say: "For me, it's not about a few black Africans, it's an entire continent."<br><br>Asked what will be his best option now that the army has been completely deposed, he said: "We will have a decision at the end of the year."<br><br>However, he added: "The problem is people don't take responsibility."<br><br>"It's just a bad situation," Mr Bobi said.<br><br>"It was not my intention on running a military. For me, you have to act the right way."<br><br>Mr Zuma - who has already ordered troops to leave his country in order to rescue former President Benigno Aquino III - has demanded political unity from the African country's minority.<br><br>He has accused rival leaders of working behind the scenes in a bid to block his efforts to improve the nation's finances.<br><br>Boko Haram took over Cameroon's north-west for about two years last year, and has pledged to take over its own capital of Kinshasa and take over its towns and villages in Kinshasa and surrounding areas.<br><br>A spokesman for the Nigerian army said three weeks ago that it was trying to persuade Nigeria's army to open its camp in Kinshasa as it tried to hold off an Islamist-led campaign to drive out the militants.<br><br>The spokesman said they were preparing to set up a security presence in the city which is being defended by police.<br><br>However, the spokesman said it had no longer been possible to establish a "precinct" outside the country, meaning that army forces would have to return to Kinshasa by the end of the year.<br><br>The military, which has been accused of supporting the war-torn Nkosazana Vows campaign to oust Nkunda president, is also trying to strengthen support for Mr Zuma in Parliament.<br><br>Mr Zuma did not immediately respond to questions about his government saying it had not been notified during the past two months of the decision to hold a snap vote on Mr Zuma until 12 February.<br><br>The opposition has said the military has been involved with the movement, not fighting.<br><br>The government says it is seeking to replace the military with the African Union.<br><br>AFP and the Associated Press broke the news on the day of Mr Zuma's inauguration as African Union chief.
