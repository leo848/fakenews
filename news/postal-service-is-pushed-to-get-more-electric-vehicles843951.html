	<div class="container">Postal Service Is Pushed To Get More Electric Vehicles<br><br>Enlarge this image toggle caption Kevin Winter/Getty Images Kevin Winter/Getty Images<br><br>Volkswagen says it plans to push its electric vehicles to get more electric vehicles.<br><br>Volkswagen's U.S. subsidiary has just announced plans to introduce a 2.7-mile-per-hour (mile-for-mile) plug-in hybrid that's just as efficient across the board. The electric car will be sold in the U.S. from 2018.<br><br>Volkswagen says it will sell the plug-in hybrid to consumers in Europe, with the U.S. starting at $1,995 in 2020. The company says its 1-mile-per-hour (1.5-mile-for-mile) drivetrain will be 100 percent electric. The European Union says it is using 80 percent energy and is now "making the transition to electric vehicles from diesel."<br><br>The plug-in hybrid is also expected to be available in the U.S. beginning in 2017. Under a new contract, Volkswagen says it will offer a 2.5-mile-per-hour (4.8-mile-for-mile) drivetrain that achieves 1.9 times better performance in its cars than conventional hybrids.<br><br>Volkswagen says the plug-in hybrid is "highly reliable and environmentally friendly." It will get a new, high-capacity battery, a hybrid-electricity system, and will also have a battery backup.<br><br>"Volkswagen has been working on a plan to build a more efficient and reliable electric vehicle and has been working closely with partners to ensure that the latest technology is ready for market in a variety of vehicle configurations," the automaker says in a statement.<br><br>This isn't the first time Volkswagen has come under scrutiny for charging its car's batteries.<br><br>The company was embroiled in controversy when it introduced its first-ever charge-and-discharge charging system for its diesel-electric cars in the late '90s.<br><br>The company has since made improvements to the technology but said the system has been plagued by reliability problems. The new system was developed by the University of California, Berkeley, and is based on the latest version of the Volt and Nissan Leaf models, which are electric cars.<br><br>"All of the new technologies you see in the market continue to need upgrading and refinement," Volkswagen's vice president of research and development for the U.S., Richard Gidley, told Bloomberg. "We're confident that the new technology will continue to meet our new customer's requirements."<br><br>Volkswagen says its plug-in hybrid powertrain will still achieve faster performance than most conventional models, while it will work faster with less energy.<br><br>Volkswagen's cars are available for purchase from the U.S. and other countries, but their price and availability are unknown. For automakers, who already have a lot of power to drive, it's worth asking about pricing.<br><br>Tesla is likely to follow up with an electric-car pricing plan soon. It'll be available in two different price points, and its car is currently available in a range of between $1,000 and $5,000.<br><br>The first car to become an electric-car is a Chevrolet Volt, which will cost $12,000, though the latter could be cheaper as well. All the cars could easily be sold for more than $2,000.
