	<div class="container">Top Health Experts Predict Another US COVID-19 Surge<br><br>(10:30 PM ET) -- On Capitol Hill (8:30 AM to 5:00 PM ET) Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) told CNBC on Monday the U.S.-led action against Russia today is a "significant" threat.<br><br>"It's a nuclear-armed attack, but there's an even more dangerous one," said Leahy.<br><br>"I think the next president has to weigh against that. It's so important to us here in the Senate to make an attack, but here we're trying to move our military closer militarily to Russia to fight a major threat."<br><br>"The fact doesn't matter if we've been bombing Syria or Iran or Russia, it matters how many times we take a missile that carries nuclear weapons. And I think all of us are right now, and frankly, I'm not on the committee, I have absolutely nothing to add at this point.<br><br>"My question is, what are you going to attack?" Leahy. "And you're going to attack Syria? Yeah, we're going to do it."<br><br>(LISTEN: Sen. Patrick Leahy on US 'Russia' Action)<br><br>Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) on Wednesday confirmed that US "action" against Iran may be underway, according to CNN.<br><br>Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) also called for a meeting of countries of the world's leaders on Thursday to develop cooperation on sanctions between Iran and countries in the region.<br><br>"All of us who believe that we can resolve this problem can at the same time make it worse," said Cruz, adding that "we're going to have to agree how to do it."<br><br>"At this point we have no idea what's going on," said Cruz at a conference on "The Heritage Foundation's Threat: Iran & North Korea."<br><br>On the House floor, Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) said that Russia is "being attacked" by its military, said there are "some very dangerous actions, and people are dying" from these attacks.<br><br>"If the U.S. is attacking a country that engages in those same violations of international law, then it's at the root of their behavior, and if we lose all confidence in our country then we absolutely have no options but to respond to it," said Gohmert.<br><br>(Also on HuffPost: 'Obama's Russia Threat Made the War Stop')<br><br>The Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee responded Friday to questioning from Sen. John McCain's (R-AZ) colleagues by declaring, "All the U.S. leaders should be aware of the real issues facing the U.S. government -- what makes them do what they are doing and what's best for our nation. We can't win with one act today, we can't win with two actions tomorrow. And that is exactly what has happened today, I think.<br><br>"The real issue is this: What of the real terrorists, the actual threats of our government and our children, those in the war on terror? Are they those same terrorists who are not going to be deterred by attacks like today because of their political, religious or moral worldview?" he continued. "Let's not forget about those who come home every morning with the same questions and concerns as the others: Why are they here? Why are they making a habit of staying home at night without getting a paycheck or the promise of good health access because they haven't brought health care into their neighborhoods yet, the promise of better job security?"<br><br>Watch the video above to learn how he was joined by Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) and other Republicans on Capitol Hill.<br><br>(TM and © Copyright 2014 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
