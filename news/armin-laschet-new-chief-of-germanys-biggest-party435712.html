	<div class="container">Armin Laschet new chief of Germany's biggest party<br><br>Germany's conservative FDP - which won the first round in October polls - is on a steep slide after its election result sparked controversy.<br><br>FDP lawmakers now believe their party could find their party "underestimated and undefended" by voters.<br><br>According to the FDP newspaper, FDP and the Greens are both at 55% of seats in parliament, and those two parties were the only two parties with a majority of seats, with one remaining in the centre right.<br><br>There is little doubt that the party is being underestimated by many voters.<br><br>As well as the party the Greens are part of the opposition coalition coalition, with their own party - the Social Democrats - forming government as usual.<br><br>The party is also divided within Merkel's own party - which has been left out in the cold of the election-year contest.<br><br>The Social Democrats (SPD), which the SPD represents, are also the party holding the government and will try to become government during a minority government in next year's parliament.<br><br>But the center left SPD is at only 55% of seats - its support in parliament dwindles.<br><br>They are also the largest party of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) led opposition coalition.<br><br>With fewer than 4% of the votes counted, the parties have had difficulty forming a coalition government.<br><br>That led to the SPD and SSB forming government in a failed coalition election following a vote last year to leave the European Union.<br><br>But after a recent debate in a political science research center in Dresden, the SPD is already finding a majority - 38 members - in the Social Democrats' coalition with FDP.<br><br>While some are still hopeful that Merkel's Social Democrats will form a government in 2019, they appear in line for more seats ahead of next year, when the party is expected to hold two seats in the Bundestag.<br><br>Sitting in the centre in Berlin's Fifth Avenue (pictured) is the Social Democrats' largest party<br><br>'We will see a coalition government, not just a coalition in 2019. The SPD and this coalition will have to be united, not apart, and no party with two seats in the Bundestag can win this in a single election,' said CDU lawmaker Matthias Schauble.<br><br>'We still have to think about our policies. Are we going to continue to defend the German language and culture? Am I worried? I am not so worried now. We're thinking about our future.<br><br>'My goal is to keep the German language alive. At the same time, do we still want to keep the values as we see them? Should we not do anything about how we govern or are we playing politics where we have to do things in certain ways?' he added.<br><br>FDP leader Steffen Seibert (far left) sits in front of the Reichswhr<br><br>Meanwhile, the CDU leader says Merkel's hard-line anti-immigrant populism isn't working out as expected, as he blames right-wing populism and the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) - which he dubs a 'Marxist-Leninist cult' - for the party's 'deflation'.<br><br>He urged Merkel to "stop talking about things that are completely different from my views on immigration and economic issues".<br><br>He said if anyone in the party is being taken advantage of, it is the AfD.<br><br>Schneder said it was the party's fault for 'unfairly blaming' the AfD for its defeat.<br><br>'We are facing the same problem if you compare the party with the 'big banks', which have taken the country under their wing,' he said.<br><br>'People have to admit that we have one big problem; we have two. When you have two big problems, you make people think there are two different problems, and sometimes there are both problems too.'
