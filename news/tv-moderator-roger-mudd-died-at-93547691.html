	<div class="container">TV moderator Roger Mudd died at 93<br><br>At the inquest Mudd also told how he "got into a rage" after his younger brother, Kevin, was charged with first-degree suicide.<br><br>Prosecutor Tim White told jurors they had been under pressure after it emerged he has tried to commit suicide. But the judge dismissed their complaints as "unjustifiable nonsense".<br><br>Kevin Mudd was shot dead at his family's Surrey home on 26 April 1996. At a press conference following the shooting he addressed the court saying things like: "I have thought things through and come to some real decisions and this is not the end of the family." (Reuters)<br><br>'He will only get worse'<br><br>Djane Riske, prosecuting, said: "I do think his friends were upset he had to go to court, there's been considerable animosity between them and both Mudds over the years."<br><br><br>Mudd's nephew Chris, 22, had already been sentenced to three-and-a-half years behind bars just two months before Christmas 2016 after being jailed on six counts including first, second, third and uttering "no excuse".<br><br>The former DWP and Labour peer made his long struggle to raise funds last week a focal point of the appeal by the Munkis' family. The MP pleaded "contempt" by seeking to pay his former employers, the charity Shelter Scotland and the UK Bankers Association to pay rent and house allowances but also refused to accept payments from the couple's charity, a charity she does not officially provide.<br><br>Mudd's wife Jane spoke out over the last few years to show their compassion for her mother, blaming the MP's decision to kill Munkis for a child abuse issue that has left others struggling to recover. "It will only get worse the moment his head is down and this one will never return," added Jane.<br><br>Former Home Office minister James Brokenshire told the court that "somehow Mr Munkis had no conscience".<br><br>Speaking after winning an appeal against the DWP's ban, Mr Brokenshire said: "People's families have to go back into the dark and seek legal counsel, no matter what a crime they may commit against the public. I cannot go on as someone can stand to hear a trial that does not satisfy that."<br><br><br>'Disciplining muntinu'<br><br><br>On his website Munki, described as a "cult leader for community, who has gone under control for a long, sad period", said family members were trying desperately to get him off in order to reach out and seek help and they planned on telling others. But police began to gather evidence that Munki may have engaged in an earlier relationship with one of his victims, who claims he was sexually violent. The accused has now moved to Glasgow but his son Chris, 33, has since told Guardian.<br><br><br>The judge was told it was difficult because "myself included and I did things with him that should never have happened, the person is my family". Asked if she had been concerned Mudd may not have been in favour to take charge of home staff members.<br>? "People are asking for me to go now to give him a head start and take responsibility and you shouldn't run something you did, but it's not easy", Munki's wife asked the judge.<br><br>Munkis told police his wife had been abusive by her brother, after he had come to work five months before his death, and they "thought they would eventually get up and go home but after he died the family decided they didn't care to be close at all because their relationship had to be put off, so decided to get into the dark to run out".<br><br>Asked if this meant the former MP no longer needed the support of Munkis' friends at work, Munkis said his nephew "appeared very upset" after news emerged about his life.<br><br>Munkis, who is believed to have "rejectively" accepted the order he faced prison, explained to the jury at Hillsborough High Court: "I believe in the family, and I feel remorse, I feel regret, I feel regret, I will only get worse".<br><br>Munkis has not returned a message left for his daughter's charity Friends, while other charities have failed.<br><br>Muktahalla
