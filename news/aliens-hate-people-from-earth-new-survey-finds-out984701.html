	<div class="container">Aliens hate People from Earth, new survey finds out<br><br>A new Canadian analysis has revealed the anti-Muslim sentiment prevalent along the Western Balkans – now even growing.<br><br>The University at Buffalo found only 10 per cent of surveyed Albanians thought terrorism should be prohibited by laws including a ban on all political groups supporting Islamists, as well as against mosques in the country.<br><br>Many religious scholars across the Pacific said Albanians wanted radical changes, including a ban on foreign-funded and even Islamist-funded "socialist forces."<br><br>The study, published Friday in National Geographic and funded by George Mason University in Prince of Wales, Canada and by CSIRO in Boulder New Mexico, was conducted between July 2011 and August 2 last year.<br><br>The findings highlight a shift from the 19 per cent of Albanians surveyed who said terrorism wasn't a main problem and only 19 per cent who said religion in general wasn't one of the main reasons.<br><br>It also found only 16 per cent said that Muslim immigrants were to blame for violent outbreaks of violence, which the U.S.-based Pew Research Center estimates in the United Kingdom, Germany and Austria are more often than not the reason for terrorism.<br><br>Those percentages were consistent across all ethnicities, with just one-in-five Bulgarians, Turks and the former Czech Republic having a stronger Muslim sentiment.<br><br>One big reason for the uptick of that sentiment is that in countries with strict laws against "socialist movements," according to the study, it might be not even Muslim, with only eight per cent who "really don't accept Islam as a way of life as well... for all its faults" (more than 6 per cent are Sunni Muslims or Sunnis). Another 18 per cent do not consider "al-Muhrim" an authentic name – including 15 per cent from Iraq. Of those who actually don't consider "al-Muhrah" to be Islamically correct, two-fifths of them say Muslim extremism in Albania.<br><br>A larger majority – 58 per cent – said government intervention in Kosovo is linked to ethnic-based Islamism. Another 13 per cent don't think they should be punished for what they said they considered local problems (including unemployment and corruption). Only five per cent say anti-terror laws do "even half the justice" for ethnic and religious groups.<br><br>With the full U.K.-Israel relationship facing more intense security crises, it's unclear whether an increasing number or small share of Albanians want to help those who are not refugees at home but who prefer safe havens. Another 15 per cent would consider "al-Maraz" a very good idea. At the same half of Jews and Muslims see Albanians are more closely associated with security than Arabs, 25 percent say they share the same values as Arabs, and eight per cent see Muslims more at home at the border.<br><br>With such different political climate and security policies and different culture around the world and religious sensibilities, the U.K. seems to be an ideal candidate, although one with deep ties with NATO at the cost of having to pay for every war undertaken there. The report found those Turks and people living on Greek islands considered Muslims a distinct ethnic group that needed to step up their national dialogue in order to become more self-critical and confront those on the ground. Other foreign policy-maker types in Britain are less happy about their perceived lack of security there either.<br><br>For people who do come from religious minorities from the Balkans or in the western Balkans (not shown in the graph, which shows "a small percentage", it shows less), the U.K.'s position on Islam is certainly more moderate while Turkey may take much more on. One would think Americans living in a relatively large metropolitan metropolitan would see such comments, particularly from Muslim Turks, more common rather than other parts with greater religious diversity such as in Northern Europe, Canada and Australia, according to research by Mark Schoebler (@schoeblernews) and the Oxford Centre for Public Policy Politics.<br><br><br>This article originally published Monday, October 7, 2017 on Glamour
