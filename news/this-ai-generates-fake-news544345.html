It's a very clever trick.<br><br>Google has developed a new algorithm that can predict which news sources are more likely to be fake news than people who are not. It's one of the most powerful ways to predict news sources, and it's one of the most effective tools for detecting fake news.<br><br>But that's not all. Another new tool, called the 'Newly-Generated Machine Intelligence,' is also coming out. Called 'Deep Learning,' it's a new way of using machine learning to predict what news sources are likely to be.<br><br>The new Deep Learning tool, called Deep Learning Alpha, has been developed by a team of researchers at Google's DeepMind Research Lab. They've been using it to create a "deep learning" algorithm that recognizes an individual's voice and then uses it to generate fake news.<br><br>That's great news, because it's a simple way to detect fake news. But it's not perfect.
