	<div class="container">Texans can still be arrested for violation business mask rules, despite mandate's end, police chief says<br><br>Baltimore police have changed their business-mask policy from a rule prohibiting people wearing blackface masks to a law that allows police to arrest people who wear the face covering.<br><br>In a letter to the mayor and police chief, police officers across Baltimore and across the nation are asking for a "tough" approach to masking their officers.<br><br>The change came after Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake declared that blackface masks are not illegal, which has led to protests in the city and elsewhere.<br><br>The new law, which applies to all police departments, will see the police use a combination of white-on-black-face masks and blackface in all departments, including police academies.<br><br>The change applies to white-on-black-face masks in all schools and all police departments.<br><br>The law does not apply to certain police departments.<br><br>Last year, Rawlings-Blake asked the federal government to make the law more stringent, saying it was needed to protect against the "unreasonable and unnecessary" use of force.<br><br>The law was approved by a vote of the nation's top constitutional court, where the decision is expected to be released later this month.<br><br>Under the new policy, people who wear blackface face masks and other body-covering items must go through a "preclearance" process on the basis of evidence, such as fingerprints, fingerprints taken at an airport or a police station, and court-ordered documentation of the use of force.<br><br>The request for the new rule applies to all police departments, including law enforcement, all police academies, police departments with training and training on the use of force, and all police officers in the city.<br><br>The law also requires police chiefs to submit an annual report of their own to the city and state legislatures.<br><br>The new policy allows police to arrest people who break the law, including those who are in uniform, but not wearing a mask, on the basis of probable cause.<br><br>"Anyone who uses a mask that is not a mask that is a mask that is clearly visible, or that is easily visible, to the public without any visible or visible object, or to a person who is not in uniform, is subject to arrest," the letter said.<br><br>The Baltimore police chief's letter to Rawlings-Blake says the new policy has been approved by the U.S. Department of Justice and has been "revised to reflect the public's growing support for police reform."<br><br>The department says the changes have "been approved by the U.S. Department of Justice and have been approved by the Baltimore City Board of Education."<br><br>Rawlings-Blake's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.<br><br>The chief also said that the officers to whom the new law applies would not be required to face criminal charges.<br><br>But the letter said the department could not be certain that the new law would be effective.<br><br>"We don't know the extent to which the change will apply to the police department, or the officers who will be subject to it," the letter said.<br><br>The police union, which represents police officers, has called the police reform law a "blatant, unconstitutional, and dangerous attempt to use the police to do what they want to do."<br><br>But the police union chief said he was concerned by the new law's language.<br><br>"I think that's an attack on the police and a continuation of the police state," he said.<br><br>"We're tired of the police state and they're tired of being able to do what they want to do and that's what the Baltimore police union is seeking to do."<br><br>The letter comes as Rawlings-Blake is seeking to secure support for the Baltimore Police Department's plan to expand its presence at the nation's largest police academy.<br><br>The plan involves upgrading the academy's training and training program, which includes a formal training program and a standardized course on police-community relations.<br><br>"The Baltimore Police Department should be the next great police department to be built on a foundation of law and order," Rawlings-Blake said in a statement.<br><br>"The department should be the first step in building a new trust and a new culture of community in the community."<br><br>
