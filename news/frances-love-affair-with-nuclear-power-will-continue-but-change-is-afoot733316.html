	<div class="container">France's love affair with nuclear power will continue, but change is afoot<br><br>At the end of January, the government announced its plan to build a new nuclear power station in the eastern Siberian province of Kaliningrad, near the Black Sea coast.<br><br>It said it would "work closely with the stakeholders of the other energy projects".<br><br>But after months of delays, the government has reached a deal to build another reactor at the site – the largest ever built in Russia.<br><br>The reactors will include two new reactors in the same block and new ones in the south-western part of the province where the plant is set to be built.<br><br>Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he does not want Western power plants to be able to produce oil and gas from the site, which will be the biggest in Europe.<br><br>But the project is still in the early stages – with a cost of less than $5bn.<br><br>At a time when Russia is battling a war in Syria with the country's main insurgent group, Russia has said Moscow will build an "emergency emergency response force" to respond to emergency situations such as refugees and food.<br><br>The project will include another two reactors and one additional reactor by 2025.<br><br>"We know we will build four more reactors, two of which will be in advanced nuclear reactors," Dmitry Medvedev, president of the Russian Nuclear Power Corporation, told state television.<br><br>Russia has built four reactors in Kaliningrad and four more in Crimea, but it has not yet finished building a new nuclear power station at the site.<br><br>Russia also has a new reactor planned for the north-western part of the country which will be built by 2017, according to a report by the Gazprom newspaper.<br><br>But with the deal to build the new reactors closed, government officials say the government has no real interest in building a new nuclear power plant, despite a plan by the Russian government to build a new nuclear power station there in 2011.<br><br>"The country doesn't want a new nuclear power plant in Russia and that is why we will build one with some sort of safety and emergency and then we will go for it," Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin said at a news conference on Thursday.<br><br>Rogozin said that Russia has plans to build four reactors in the north-western part of the country to replace the existing ones.<br><br>But the construction of the new reactors were so long that local authorities in the province did not allow them to operate.<br><br>The construction of the new reactors was part of the government's plan to have four new reactors in the province during the next four to six years, but Rogozin said such new reactors "will not be built".<br><br>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the government had not said whether any new reactors were mentioned in the agreement.<br><br>Speaking after the announcement, Rosatom's President Igor Girkin said that any new reactors being built in the eastern province of Kaliningrad would be "an upgrade".<br><br>But Gazprom, which is owned by Russia's largest state-controlled energy company Rosneft, said that it had already had a nuclear power plant project planned in Kaliningrad by the end of July.<br><br>"It is true that there are two nuclear reactors in the region but the decision is up to the state," said Gazprom.<br><br>Billionaire Sergei Chernomirsky, the head of the Rosneft government, had already built up his stock of gas and electricity for the project, according to Gazprom, and had also put forward a plan to build five new reactors in the eastern province.<br><br>Vladimir Putin (R) speaks at the opening ceremony of the Chernobyl-1 plant for its energy plant construction in Chernobyl, Ukraine, on February 24, 2010.<br><br>Russia's new nuclear power plant in Kaliningrad will help to transform the country around nuclear power, said Alexei Miller, a former director of the UN nuclear watchdog.<br><br>"We know that Russia is not going to use nuclear weapons, but the whole world is on the verge of doing something," Miller said.
