Löfner from the University of Leicester.<br><br>"It's still under observation today, but we can tell that it's a dwarf planet."<br><br>The discovery also appears to have implications for how the Big Bang theory was proposed 10,000 years ago, by theorists who argued that all the stars became material and became more dense.
