	<div class="container">Goldman Sachs to invest 10 billion over 10 years to support Black women<br><br>On Tuesday, it was announced that Barclays Capital and Royal Bank of Scotland will invest £1.7 billion over 10 years to support Black women, including a 50 per cent new investment funding for the company.<br><br>The announcement comes after a series of disappointing announcements in the bank's year-end financial year, notably high interest rates and declining returns.<br><br>This prompted Morgan Stanley to warn that, without serious progress, the UK will no longer have time to deal with the challenges as it has previously had to deal with global turmoil, an idea that has caused tensions among both the banking industry and its members that is further compounded by its apparent lack of financial backing.<br><br>While investment flows on Wall Street have increased nearly nine times in the past decade, the Bank of England has never had to make the big changes that are required as they have done under both the Clinton administration and Obama's policies.<br><br>However, if this policy is seen as an impediment to growth while working with banks at their best, that could bring the price of living up in the banking sector down, with the effect on the overall level of capital being eroded.<br><br>"If it is seen that this will have a negative and even a negative impact on the overall capital movement then its time to change the policy of those responsible and that's going to change the overall capital movement," said an industry consultant, who wished to remain anonymous. "That could have a negative impact on the direction of the economy here. And it certainly could affect the quality of London, in particular the financial services sector."<br><br>"If we are seeing a decrease in the price of sterling, or lower oil prices... it could have a negative impact on the overall capital movement as a result of negative moves by other financial markets and that could mean a lower investment return for our firms in London," stressed the consultant.<br><br>The Barclays analyst says the new investment plans from HSBC, Morgan Stanley and Bank of Scotland shows the Bank of England has taken steps to ensure a high level of investment will be made in the long-term to avoid a "catastrophic effect" on the future of the financial industry.<br><br>"They've shown a little more clarity on these risks, now they talk about the consequences of taking money out of the economy and of trying to lower the rates so that we do a more effective job for everyone within the institutions we are working at with the most senior leaders like the Governor of the Bank of England," said the analyst.<br><br>On Sunday, Barclays CEO Chris Stevens has said that the institution has given up the belief that making money in London - which Barclays currently has to build an entire tower-dwelling tower complex in the boroughs of Bedfordshire - was an option, saying it had failed to deliver "adequate" benefits for people affected by the economic downturn.<br><br>But the Bank of England was keen to dispel concerns expressed by senior bankers and officials after the bank announced this week that it would pay a £500 million tax on people who made more than £200,000 - a prospect that is being challenged by the group that says capital from Britain's most deprived areas should be treated like any other capital.<br><br>The move will give the bank more access to wealthy people who will also be taxed on the amount of profits held by the bank.<br><br>John Sweeney, a research banker at HSBC who was also part of an analysis of the recent Bank of England announcement as well as others made by Mr Stevens, told The Guardian that, while he believes that capital flowing into the UK is being effectively taxed, his experience speaking to the Wall Street Journal had led him to believe that "it's hard for most bankers and others thinking of buying companies or investing in them."<br><br>"I think this is a very important moment for us as shareholders that these kinds of actions, when done correctly, are really being taken very far into the pockets of the bank that invest," he added.<br><br>"If there is no support from both the political system over all that the investment should be going in, then that will affect the economy and I think our investors won't find a good reason to buy the company that we already have in place."<br><br>Meanwhile, it is yet to be confirmed whether Morgan Stanley will be paying back any of its £2 billion bail-out commitments.
