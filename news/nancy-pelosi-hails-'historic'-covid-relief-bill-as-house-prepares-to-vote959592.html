	<div class="container">Nancy Pelosi hails 'historic' Covid relief bill as House prepares to vote on it.<br><br>In California, Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is expected to reintroduce a bill to allow the state's medical marijuana industry to legally sell medical marijuana to patients with debilitating conditions.<br><br>The measure would allow patients to sell their medical cannabis in any way to patients who are suffering from a debilitating condition.<br><br>The legislation comes after California voters approved Proposition 1, which legalized medical marijuana in November.<br><br>The measure requires patients with debilitating conditions to buy an ounce or less of medical marijuana at a dispensary, which will then be available to patients in the regular market.<br><br>The measure also requires patients to notify their state officials of a physician's recommendation that they will receive a prescription for cannabis if they have a debilitating condition.<br><br>Although dispensaries already have their own medical marijuana programs, they will be able to sell the product to patients who do not have medical cannabis.<br><br>The marijuana industry has been lobbying lawmakers for years to allow this provision to be part of a larger package of measures.<br><br>The California Medical Marijuana Act was introduced in 2008, and has been a key part of the Democratic Party platform since then.<br><br>The bill would allow the state to purchase up to 90 days' supply of medical marijuana for patients.<br><br>The proposal also includes a provision stating that "Medical marijuana is not a substitute for or substitute for drugs."<br><br>If the current legislation becomes law, the medical marijuana industry remains illegal.<br><br>The California Medical Cannabis Act also allows patients to sell their medical cannabis to patients and obtain one ounce or less for "immediate dispensation by patients with debilitating conditions."<br><br>The legislation also requires patients with a debilitating condition to notify their state officials of a physician's recommendation that they will receive a prescription for cannabis if they have a debilitating condition.
