	<div class="container">People who read the news are more likely to get depressed, new study finds out<br><br>The finding could be important for doctors who prescribe pain medications because they believe these substances are safe, according to a paper published in the journal Psychological Medicine.<br><br>"Studies have noted a significant health benefit from pain medications that are safe, and the evidence has been consistently mixed and varied," said lead author John Schulte of the University of Pennsylvania's School of Medicine.<br><br>The scientists analyzed data from 513 patients with pain diagnoses and found a significant association between the pain medications and mood disorders, such as irritability, depression and anxiety.<br><br>More than half didn't meet the definition of a mood disorder because they needed to take medication to help solve them, while 13 percent did so for anxiety.<br><br>The high frequency of use of pain medications in the general population, though, suggests that they may be helpful for pain medications, the authors write in the paper.<br><br>"This is consistent with the previous finding that this is associated with improvements in physical activity, stress relief and mood regulation but not with any overall health benefits," Schulte said.<br><br>While pain medications may not have the same health benefits as opioid analgesics, this new study could change that. "By looking at pain and anxiety in a patient's physical health history, we can explore the use of these medications (or other pain relievers) in a different way," Schulte said.<br><br>The team is now looking for a way to evaluate if pain medications increase happiness or distress among patients who use them, rather than just a measure of subjective health.<br><br>Researchers will gather data on six types of pain medications in the future. It will also examine whether the medication used in the current study was related to a group of chronic pain patients who had a history of severe pain and not a prior history of cancer or any other medical condition.<br><br>The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the Brain, and Behavioural Science Research Council and the National Institute on Drug Abuse.<br><br>Original research: Abstract<br><br>Original work: Abstract for Abstract for The journal Psychological Medicine<br><br>Copyright and license to Nature Communications, Inc. 2016.
