	<div class="container">Scientists found out, but went back in again<br><br>The team, led by Professor Robert S. Williams, a professor of neurobiology at the University of California, San Diego, and one of the authors of the study, said that the results of the study "suggest that the brain is not merely a process of learning, but rather a system of sensory and motor coordination."<br><br>The findings are published in the journal Current Biology.<br><br>"The finding that the brain is a system of sensory and motor coordination suggests that the brain is not simply a process of learning, but rather a system of sensory and motor coordination," Williams said.<br><br>The study was conducted in a laboratory at the University of California, San Diego, where Williams was a postdoctoral researcher.<br><br>Williams said the findings were "really exciting."<br><br>"We have shown that the brain is not simply a process of learning," he said. "It's a system of sensory and motor coordination."<br><br>The study was funded by the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.<br><br>The researchers said that the results of the study could help inform future research into the role of the brain in the development of learning and memory, as well as the development of new treatments for learning disorders.<br><br>"We know that the brain is involved in many different aspects of learning and memory, including the development of new skills and learning strategies," Williams said. "But we also know that the brain is a system of sensory and motor coordination."<br><br>The study was supported by the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation
