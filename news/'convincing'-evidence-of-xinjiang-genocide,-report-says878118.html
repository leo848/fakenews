	<div class="container">Convincing' evidence of Xinjiang genocide, report says.<br><br>The report was published in a report by the Global Studies Institute, which provides a range of international perspective on these issues.<br><br>It says the Uighur people are the largest ethnic group in Xinjiang, and it states that the Uighurs who fled from China in the 1990s should not be regarded as a group worthy of inclusion.<br><br>Shabir-e-Islami said that the Uighurs have had their share of problems, but the Uighurs should not be treated as "another ethnic group in an ethnic group".<br><br>He added that the Uighurs should be allowed to return to China and be treated as a part of society.<br><br>The report claims that China has systematically banned the Uighurs, saying that the practice of using "illegal methods of identification" is not allowed, and that the Uighurs are not allowed to become a part of the Chinese government.<br><br>In a statement, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said that the Uighur census and the Uighur-led legal process to return to China were all part of the Chinese government's aim to "improve relations between the two countries".<br><br>The Uighur minority has long been denied their traditional status as a sub-caste of the Chinese state, but China has been criticised for its restrictive policies towards their ethnic group.
