	<div class="container">Neanderthals disappeared from Europe thousands of years earlier than we thought.<br><br>The researchers also found that the oldest known fossils of Neanderthals were in Africa, a region where an unusually large number of birds survived, but where the last known Europeans lived in the region. The researchers speculate that the fossils were from the end of the Pleistocene, which was about 4 million years ago, and that the fossils were from the end of the Pleistocene, which was between 5 million and 6 million years ago.<br><br>The researchers are now looking at more ancient fossils from the same region, which could allow them to rule out a Neanderthal presence.<br><br>"We're very confident that we know where the Neanderthals originated," says University of Minnesota evolutionary biologist Daniel J. Peebles. "But we still don't know where they went. If we find them, we may find that they didn't live in Africa until about 5 million years ago."<br><br>The researchers have published their findings online July 7 in the journal Science.<br><br>The research is supported by the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation's Grant Number R01CA013550 and the National Science Foundation's Research and Development Office.<br><br>Follow Denise Chow on Twitter at @denisechow.
