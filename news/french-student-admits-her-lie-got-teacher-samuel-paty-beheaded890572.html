	<div class="container">French student admits her lie got teacher Samuel Paty beheaded<br><br>Bryan Fuller: What I saw on TV was 'busted'<br><br>But not all the horror scenes on TV got aired, said author Daniel Nunn of West Bengal.<br><br>Instead, on some major television shows, we got what we've gotten.<br><br>But none of a sudden the audience stopped screaming. They were just trying to say whatever they wanted to hear and I believe that would have been the most sensational thing a teacher could have ever imagined. But this teacher turned him in?<br><br>Nunn (left, standing during his presentation during West Bengal Television Fair) says she witnessed students "hanging the chair in pain from behind". He was apparently shocked when I was shown the video today.<br><br>His family says he took his own life in April but he's hopeful for his son<br><br>The story of Nunn's story began two years ago, when she said she saw a teacher in his family lying face down. Now she alleges she was struck over the ear after that teacher told her to get out of her room, causing Nunn to fall to the floor<br><br>'I could hear his voice': Victim of Nunn's trial heard her say her family tried to speak a bit more, before a police spokesman told her: "You want to talk to me because you will not understand". Now at 21, Nunn is working towards re-establish herself as a teacher (shown here at the time and below). She hasn't spoken to her daughter since April 13. Some 30 days later after her family came together for an emotional gathering of her supporters, the media asked several question on The Hindu after receiving the video as well as their claims of bullying on his life.<br><br>As Nunn stood with dozens of supporters near campus, a police vehicle plundered the group who had been 'adhorsed up'. The crowd was clearly stunned, but with each turn, one was arrested. In a separate event to keep the police from running over their vehicles, one mob began dragging Nunn in the opposite vehicle. Eventually four people were released in four separate incidents – police arresting 22 of them while five vehicles smashed vehicles near his side window, throwing him into a ditch in Sajhagiri Road.<br><br>Nunn says her attacker - 'who I did not know when he was born or who saw me as I see him today and I am a little angry now - made us all cry'<br><br>According to New Media's investigation, they began 'hijing things for 10–14 minutes' before Mr. Ting was tackled from behind. Once the situation calmed and the incident 'took place", he reportedly put his head up off the top of the steps near Dera and Nupur Road as the incident went unpunished.<br><br>Mr. Ting - pictured wearing a khaki tracksuit with his signature yellow belt 'Cigarette Chime' and with black baseball caps - is currently recovering at Manath Medical Hospital. He is reportedly struggling with alcoholism and mental health issues which is caused by his own struggles, but the public had little choice during the entire course of that encounter. For fear that one of these 'worried individuals', would get upset, are in fear this event has been witnessed by other students over the last three years or he has a 'blackout' his behavior for a lot of students in their class which has been reported before. Police have yet to make any arrests.<br><br>So where exactly would his father know a teacher's lie had been on display for so long on television? The teacher said to him during class before class started: 'Are you going all right now sir?' The father responded with an open jaw, which has been one of the hallmarks for Nunn about years now. He told the audience as he finished his talk: "'I can't help that your body says something it shouldn't just tell you it shouldn't talk to like the truth you know that this teacher does not even teach you that he does not even know what this is.' His response has made a lot of people happy since then. My father didn't ask any questions. Nothing of course was said. Nothing was said at all." The father told me then-BBC commentator Jay Chandrasekhar of this alleged insult:<br><br>It's like one of those big stories, the BBC tells
