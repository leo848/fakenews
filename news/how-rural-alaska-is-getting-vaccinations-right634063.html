We are also the only one of the seven states where we have the ability to have vaccination right now, and that is the right part of this," he said.<br><br>He added that in the meantime, health officials are working to get more people vaccinated.<br><br>"I think the fact that there is so many people with the flu at this time is really concerning because I think that there is a lot of need for the vaccine right now," he said. "I think it's very important to have vaccines for both people."<br><br>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will soon begin tracking the number of people vaccinated for the flu in the United States from November through June. According to the CDC, about 1,500 new cases of the flu in the first nine months of this year were reported in the U.S.<br><br>Last month, the CDC announced that its flu surveillance program had been expanded to cover about 6,000 people in four states, including Alaska, and its flu center in Anchorage has been equipped with a new flu-exposure prevention system that will provide a more effective response to the flu than the current system.
