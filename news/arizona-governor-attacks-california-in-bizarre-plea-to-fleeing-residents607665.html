	<div class="container">Arizona governor attacks California in bizarre plea to 'fleeing' residents<br><br>Statehouse of New York GOP lawmaker vows she will 'continue speaking about immigration only after the very real crisis in the United States hits.'<br><br>Rep. Tom Cole in Raleigh, north of Raleigh, calls for GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump to be fired from its Senate race (AP Photo/Hilary Hunter)<br><br>"I'm going to keep speaking about immigration only after my fellow citizens in this country have got the courage to say our case of illegal immigration makes our democracy and our nation stronger," Cole told Fox News' Chuck Todd this morning.<br><br>Republicans say that's because of a 2011 Supreme Court decision that said states cannot legalize "any measure that would significantly reduce immigrant flows into the United States."<br><br>While many of those immigration policies were repealed by President Ronald Reagan or Ronald Reagan's second term, President Barack Obama pushed for more border enforcement during the first term of he presidency and increased enforcement efforts during this time.<br><br>Republicans have attempted to dismantle President-elect Donald Trump's administration by demanding that he deport all of the millions of illegal immigrants who crossed into the country from the former Soviet nation. A Democratic federal prosecutor has asked the Supreme Court to stay decision of Obama's 2012 executive orders about deportations.<br><br>House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis. said: "When a Republican tries to rollbacks our nation's laws and rollbacks the rule of law, it simply fails the test. And by 'fail' I don't just mean being anti-immigration, but trying to force this country to think more critically about its people's lives and the fundamental values put forward by this country."<br><br>Rep. Darrell Issa in San Antonio, who represents parts of Miami-Dade and El Monte counties, said that after Trump declared immigration "an issue that will determine how we are for generations to come," his party began to look ahead for the next campaign. (Jason Aldacek in Washington)<br><br>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also tweeted that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has called for a shutdown of the government "until both houses meet to take a clear path forward to pass immigration reform that ends deportable illegal immigration, and ends the mass deportation of American citizens who were here before Trump became President."<br><br>Sen. Dean Heller of Texas said Wednesday, despite what Republican Republicans may see as a lack of understanding as to Trump's plans to deport undocumented immigrants, "I think what we are seeing is Trump's administration coming in with a plan. We're going to have to hear our nominee on how those policies are structured in my view."<br><br>A spokesman for Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska suggested that Senate Republicans may have a plan and if they do not it would come up for consideration by the Republican chamber.<br><br>Follow Mike Seitz-Wald on Twitter at @mikeseitz.
