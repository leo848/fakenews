	<div class="container">Men should earn less than women, feminists say<br><br>By the end of this year, it could come to light that the current system is doing a lot to prevent women from coming forward as victims of misconduct. Last year, for example, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed its formal complaint against the NCAA for failing to provide women with equal protection of the law in its 2014 sexual misconduct policy. While NCAA law has not changed since those allegations were first made, the current policies are still in place and many schools continue to enforce them.<br><br>A woman's right to file a complaint can be considered as a form of discrimination against others, as women are still denied the opportunity to challenge their unfair treatment, despite the fact that such a claim could lead to their being expelled from the university, and their family being threatened outright if they do not follow through on their request. Additionally, if the NCAA has not followed its own protocols, it could end up with new rules that require universities to follow certain practices, such as requiring students to attend public or private events that they say violate their "gender identity."<br><br>"One of the things that has always scared me about our universities was what might happen to women who file a complaint," says Leland Durden, executive director of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. "There was a huge change that went into this and I think that it scared me more than anything. So I just wanted to put a stop to it. [But] this is not just some guy who's been on our campus. This is a huge school. I know how they feel about all of this."<br><br>As a result of the recent changes, the Commission has established a panel to review the current policies and guidelines, which require colleges and universities to follow a set of procedures similar to those created in response to last year's NCAA case. The panel will meet again in September or October to examine the new policies and procedures, and examine the current policy and regulations in light of the recent changes—as well as to continue to work to ensure that student-athletes are protected and equal treatment for athletes and others by taking action against sexual harassment on American University's campus and by hiring and hiring with the goal of ensuring more transparency and accountability at the institution.<br><br>"It is important that university administrators have the ability to take the appropriate steps to address a student-athlete's concerns and pursue appropriate recourse," Durden said. "However, by giving individuals the right to speak their mind and report any complaint to Title IX, such a process is not only unfair, it is also unfair in the face of an investigation. This can happen to any of us."<br><br>The Commission has received "very encouraging reports" regarding the NCAA's handling of the issue, says Anita Dyer, a senior scholar of Title IX at the University of Illinois-Chicago, who studies the effects of Title IX on women on the college athletics landscape.<br><br>"It has had huge positive outcomes, which we need to hear more about," Dyer said. "We don't have an effective mechanism to take action. In fact, a lot of the reporting by the NCAA has been so negative."<br><br>Last June, the NCAA's Title IX Division II Committee made a recommendation to the commission to improve compliance with gender-based workplace, and added safeguards intended to ensure that an individual's right to report violations against others is honored as well. The committee also reviewed many of the NCAA's proposed regulations on Title IX and recommended that, by September, schools should follow the same nondiscrimination and nondiscrimination standards that the university has adopted in its Title IX policies and procedures to ensure that all of its student-athletes comply with all Title IX procedures.<br><br>"It's been disappointing to see how the new rule changes have impacted so many students," Dyer said. "We need student-athletes to know that if they go to a new school, there is no reason any of them are going to feel excluded from their experience. We are asking everyone to take their own steps to protect their concerns, so that they can speak their mind by doing research, reporting concerns to the law provider, and hopefully it will take them down and get help at their local school or local university. Hopefully it doesn't take that long for other students—and especially if other students have a history of going to the same school as them to report abuse to the NCAA's Office of Compliance.<br>
