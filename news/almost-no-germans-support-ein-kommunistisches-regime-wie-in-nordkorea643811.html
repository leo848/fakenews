	<div class="container">Almost no Germans support "ein kommunistisches Regime wie in Nordkorea"<br><br>– Hans-Jürgen Grünstner, NSDAP, July 16, 1994.<br><br>German National Socialist Party of Germany<br><br>The "Velvet Revolution" in Germany<br><br>In 1920, NSDAP's general secretary, Hans Frisch wrote, "We see no evidence that the German communists will abandon Marxism completely. We know that they have nothing useful in a party founded under the leadership of the workers movement…."<br><br>At the turn of the century, this position was challenged by several communist leaders. These included Karl Polanyi, a Marxist and chairman of the NSDAP. In his autobiography, The German Communist Party, in 1921, he wrote of himself:<br><br>I am very much at a loss. Why, before the war, were my people not in such a position as I am now? This would have been the beginning of the end of our party. When the last day passes, we will be able to do all things.<br><br>The second time, NSDAP wrote, "There is no need to look at the German leaders. We have already decided to change history. We are not in Germany. There will be no more lies, no more propaganda, the world is now too busy with politics. The whole system has been decided for our benefit."<br><br>The "German Revolution" in Germany<br><br>That was also the first time that NSDAP's "German Marxist Theory of Social-Democracy" published itself in Germany.<br><br>Even here, NSDAP's ideas of political liberty were very similar: "Germany must never let its people become oppressed or enslaved…."<br><br>NSDAP's political freedom was given up in the German National Socialist Party of Germany in 1933 and, in the subsequent years, its anti-fascist policy changed. It rejected fascism's "fascist" ideologies. In a 1936 speech, NSDAP's leader Heinrich Himmler said "we have no enemies, but only enemies with our history!" Now, in the wake of events in Libya, NSDAP is now even more isolated, its ideology under attack.<br><br>"An international revolution that tries to overthrow one-world governments and the rule of law, of the proletariat and the weak, of the proletariat against any form of socialism," a slogan adopted by NSDAP, is now being promoted throughout the NSDAP movement. In the 1930s, it used this rhetoric to call for an International Red Army, called the "Red Army, Red Army, Red Army."<br><br>In its most popular propaganda, NSDAP calls for "demarche" of Marxism, a doctrine adopted by communists over the last 50 years. In 1935, it was called "Lenin's Red Army." And in 1937, it said the International Red Army was a "pure revolutionary movement."<br><br>In its latest program, NSDAP has been described as a "Social-Democrat Party [Wolenschaftssung] of the proletariat and the weak." In other words, it has been said to be a Communist party founded under the leadership of the proletariat, which has led to "Democracies" today.<br><br>The International Red Army, now called the International Red Army Committee (ILA), was led by Joseph Stalin in 1952, when it emerged from the Soviet Union as one of the most "revolutionary" and "fascistic" Communist parties in the world. It was a party that was known for its commitment to the destruction of European and Eurasian imperialism, the conquest of socialist economies as well as the exploitation of indigenous peoples in order to expand capitalist exploitation and exploitation practices throughout its region.<br><br>During the 1930s, NSDAP advocated an "international government" based on international solidarity and democracy while defending the rights of the oppressed by eliminating the "bourgeois" state with no commitment to the use of force. At the same time, some of the members of NSDAP's leadership are still in Germany. The International Red Army and the International Red Army Committee have remained at the forefront of the communist struggle in the United States and in European Europe, and with the support of most of the Communist Parties worldwide.<br><br>In 1941, the International Red Army and its International Red Army Composition Committee launched the program of "revolution."
