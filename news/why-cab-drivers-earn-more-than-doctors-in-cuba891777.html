	<div class="container">Why cab drivers earn more than doctors... in Cuba<br><br>The taxi companies that make up the vast majority of the taxi fleet in Cuba are not so much taxi drivers or taxi drivers as the country's other major employers. Most taxi drivers in Cuba are independent contractors, making up about 50 percent of the workforce.<br><br>According to the National Council of Taxi Drivers, the taxi industry in Cuba ranks second in the world for the number of taxi drivers in the country. It's on par with the United States, where four out of ten taxi drivers in the country are independent contractors.<br><br>"The taxi industry in Cuba has become a major force in the economy of Cuba," said Francisco Franco, director of the National Council of Taxi Drivers. "And it's getting stronger every year."<br><br>Franco said there is a growing demand for taxi drivers from abroad. Taxi drivers have already made a big impact in Cuba, in the form of the successful start-up of a small, privately owned company called RCA, which raised over $21 million in a single day.<br><br>The company's founder, Jose Maria Zobristo, received a lot of media attention in the past year. But in the last year, there has been a lot of media attention focused on the fact that the cab drivers are not the same people who make up the majority of the workforce in Cuba.<br><br>Even though the government has not made public the number of taxi drivers in Cuba, the official press release issued by the Taxi Workers Union that was released on August 7 said that the workforce of the taxi company is "increasing by a huge margin."<br><br>"Fifty percent of the cab drivers in Cuba pay more than the average worker," the press release said. "The average worker earns more than half the wages of the average worker in Cuba.<br><br>"The average worker earns more than half the wages of the average worker in Cuba," the press release said. "The average worker earns more than half the wages of the average worker in Cuba."<br><br>As for the taxi industry in Cuba, the government has not made public the number of cab drivers in Cuba. However, the government has made public the number of taxi drivers who earn more than 250,000 pesos ($6,500) per month.<br><br>According to the government, the number of taxi drivers in Cuba is growing at an astonishing rate.<br><br>"The number of taxi drivers in Cuba is growing at an astonishing rate. It's nearly four times the amount of taxi drivers in the United States, and it's more than two times the number in Japan. In fact, it's more than a third of the number in Switzerland, a third of the number in Singapore, and a third of the number in the United Kingdom," said Franco.<br><br>But if the government continues to push this number up, it will be a good thing for the Cuban people.<br><br>"The government has to push this up, because there will be a lot of pressure to create jobs," said Franco. "If this gets pushed back, it will be a disaster for the people of Cuba and the entire world."<br><br>If the government does not push this number up and keeps the number of taxi drivers in Cuba down, the taxi industry in Cuba will become more competitive, and the number of taxi drivers in Cuba will rise faster.<br><br>"The taxi industry in Cuba is growing at an astonishing rate," said Franco. "It's nearly four times the amount of taxi drivers in the United States, and it's more than two times the number in Japan. In fact, it's more than a third of the number in Switzerland, a third of the number in Singapore, and a third of the number in the United Kingdom."<br><br>So, it's important for the Cuban people to know that the government is not putting up a fight to protect the taxi industry.<br><br>"The government is fighting for its interests, and not for the interests of the taxi industry," said Franco. "The government is fighting for the interests of the taxi industry, not for the interests of the taxi industry."<br><br>So, to make things even more clear, there are a lot of ways that the government can and will fight for the taxi industry in Cuba.<br><br>First, the government has set up a website called "Cuba Taxi Workers' Union" that will make it easy for the Cuban people to get involved in the
